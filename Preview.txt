So far I have mostly completed the 'base' for my project. I have the mouth that will be 'eating' the earth mostly set up, though I may end up moving it over somewhat. Similarly, I have the earth mostly ready to go, along with a background to give it a better sense of scale. I'm not sure quite how happy I am with the size of the mouth so far, I may end up making my image slightly more square so that there is less sky not taken up by the mouth. Beyond that, I think I may also change the coloration of the mouth from its current one, maybe to something more oily. I may not end up doing so however as the color is slowly growing on me and really clashes wonderfully with the dark blues that make up most of the rest of the image. The main thing I still need to add is the climate change imagery to the mouth. I plan to make the tongue an oilspill-like color and have the teeth filled with images like pollutants, smokestacks, factories, fires, that sort of thing. I have several images already picked out for this purpose but thats my main work in progress right now. Beyond that I also need to finish cleaning up the teeth and around the edges of the planet, as they are still quite ragged. Thats mostly a matter of zooming in very far and carefully deleting it a few pixels at a time to get a nice smooth circle. Finally, I'm still trying to decide if I want to do anything with the bit of space to the bottom left of the planet. The mouth I liked best is somewhat crooked, extending more above than it does on the bottom. As such, I have an open area of space in part of the bottom. I initially chose an interesting photo for the background in order to account for this open space, but I think it might be worth considering adding something else into that open space. I was thinking maybe a small picture of mars or something, to represent how we are spreading our terrible ways further into the universe.
